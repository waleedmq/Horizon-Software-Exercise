<h1>VWAP test</h1>
<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
<p>You need an internet connection to download the dependencies of this project.</p>
<p>And a JDK installed. Any recent JDK should be good as this project has been tested using Java 8, Java 11 and Java 17.</p>
<h2>Gradle</h2>
<p>This practice is a <a href="https://gradle.org">Gradle</a> Java project.</p>
<p>Recent IDEs, like <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a> or <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, are able to open the <code>build.gradle</code> file as a project file and achieve all the required setup.</p>
<p>In this documentation when <code>gradlew</code> is used it means <code>gradlew.bat</code> for Windows and <code>./gradlew</code> for Unix-like OS.</p>
<h2>Practice</h2>
<p>As it will be explained below </p>
<ol>
  <li>The main entry point of this practice is the <code>com.hsoft.practice.VwapTrigger</code> class.</li>
  <li>Provided automatic tests will be used to validate your solution.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The goal of this test is to compare data coming from a provider and react to given conditions.</p>
<p>The provider notifies two types of data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pricing Data: Fair Value of a product, calculated by an internal system.</li>
  <li>Market Data: Quantity and Price of the latest exchange transaction on a product.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Functionality to implement</h3>
<h4>Pricing Data</h4>
<p>Starting in the <code>com.hsoft.practice.VwapTrigger</code> class you will receive Pricing Data through the <code>fairValueChanged</code> method.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>fairValueChanged("P1", 11.0)
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; Fair Value for P1 is 11.0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>fairValueChanged("P1", 10.9)
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; Fair Value for P1 is 10.9</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>fairValueChanged("P2", 12.5)
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; Fair Value for P1 is unchanged</li>
      <li>=&gt; Fair Value for P2 is 12.5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Market Data</h4>
<p>Still in the <code>com.hsoft.practice.VwapTrigger</code> class you will receive Market Data through the <code>transactionOccurred</code> method. Using these Market Data we ask you to compute the <code>Volume Weighted Average Price</code> (VWAP) over the five last transactions received for each product. If less than five transactions were reported on a given product, the VWAP will be calculated using all the transactions available for this product.</p>
<p>VWAP formula to implement is: <img src="vwap-formula.png" alt="vwap-formula.png" /></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>transactionOccurred("P1", 1000, 10.0)
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; VWAP for P1 = 1000 * 10.0 / 1000 = 10.0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>transactionOccurred("P1", 2000, 11.0)
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; VWAP for P1 = (1000 * 10.0 + 2000 * 11.0) / (1000 + 2000) = 10.6666666</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>transactionOccurred("P2", 500, 12.0)
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; VWAP for P1 is unchanged</li>
      <li>=&gt; VWAP for P2 = (500 * 12.0) / (500) = 12.0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Pricing Data versus VWAP</h4>
<p>Each time a new transaction occurs, or a new fair value is provided, compare the latest VWAP with the latest Fair Value. If the VWAP is greater than the Fair Value, then trigger an event to the <code>vwapTriggerListener</code> using its <code>vwapTriggered(...);</code> method. See <code>com.hsoft.practice.VwapTrigger</code>.</p>
<p>You can add your code in the current methods of <code>com.hsoft.practice.VwapTrigger</code> and/or you can create new methods, new classes, new interfaces, new dependencies etc. to achieve your solution.</p>
<h3>Test Result / Expectation</h3>
<p><strong>To validate</strong> your solution you must execute <code>gradlew test</code>. It will execute two unit tests asserting events (the ones that you will trigger when comparing the latest VWAP with the latest Fair Value), and will ensure that the Fair Price and VWAP are the expected one for some products.</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>ExpectationTest.singleThreaded</code>: the same thread will be used to notify all Pricing Data and Market Data. This test  is <strong>mandatory</strong>.</li>
  <li><code>ExpectationTest.multiThreaded</code>: several threads will be used to notify Pricing Data and Market Data. It means that  you can receive Pricing Data for different products at the "same time". Or receive Pricing Data while receiving  Market Data (and vice-versa).  This test is <strong>optional</strong> if you are not comfortable with  multi-threading. But even if you are not comfortable with multi-threading it will be good to try. We will then  debrief it and discuss the difficulties.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition of these provided tests you can add your own tests in the <code>com.hsoft.practice.VwapTriggerTest</code>, and/or in another <code>XxxxTest</code> class. They will also be executed by <code>gradlew test</code></p>
<p>A tests report will be available, and should be located under <code>build/reports/tests/test/index.html</code>. You can also run the tests in your IDE.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This project comes with internal classes to be able to generate and test your implementation. These classes are  located  in <code>com.hsoft.internal</code> package. Candidate must not modify them and doesn't need to check/understand them to achieve  this practice.  Actually an obfuscation has been achieved on these classes to show that they are not important to resolve the  practice. They must be seen as a black-box library.</li>
  <li>Log4j2 is available and can be used to log.</li>
  <li>Solution must be provided as if the produced code will be put in production (i.e. code quality, clarity).</li>
  <li>Lastly don't hesitate to ask any question if you are blocked during the practise. Something can be not clear, or you  may  encounter issue due to your local setup.</li>
</ul>
